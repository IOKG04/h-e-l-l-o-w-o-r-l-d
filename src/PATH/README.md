# PATH

PATH is an esoteric programming language, which I (rue04) randomly found here: https://esolangs.org/wiki/PATH

This is a transpiler from PATH to c, ansi c to be specific.

## IMPORTANT

In case you decide to look at the code, please note that this isn't my (rue04's) usual coding style,
I am not *that* unhireable.

The style done is for purposes of making the compiler take just a little more to remove comments, etc.
